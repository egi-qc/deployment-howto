This repository contains the most recent configuration files used in the
deployment of UMD and CMD products (as part of the EGI verification effort).

The content of this repository is automatically updated by EGI verification's
[Jenkins service](https://jenkins.egi.ifca.es) -- located at IFCA datacenter --
every time there is a new successful build, identified by the product's name
and the operating system used.

Each build is documented with a how-to guide for the product deployment, aiming
to server as a reference for the installation and configuration of UMD and CMD
products in external environments, such as EGI infrastructure resource providers.
